Yesterday I cooked another another recipe from my Christmas present, the outstanding [China Study Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Cookbook-Plant-Based-Recipes/dp/1937856755), the one for African Vegetables. This is the fifth recipe we've made out of this book, and so far every one has been a keeper. <!-- More --> This recipe, especially, came out delicious, even though at first I was a bit nervous about the weird ingredient list that included cinnamon, corn, zucchini, and spinach, sweet potatoes, and peanut butter!

My photo doesn't do it justice, but here it is:
