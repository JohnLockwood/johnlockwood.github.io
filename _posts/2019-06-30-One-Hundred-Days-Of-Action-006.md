Today's day SIX of 100 Days of Action to end childhood concentration camps on the Southern US Border.  Today I made the decision definitely not to try to compete with the Lights For Liberty Event in Charlotte -- well, [sort of in Charlotte](https://www.facebook.com/events/396883404264124/) and have clarified that the one that was going to be [really in Charlotte](https://www.facebook.com/events/2349283675314220/) is now cancelled.  So I had to write clarifying my position to one of the advocates of the Charlotte event that's not in Charlotte.

I also spent some time talking to a Pastor who wanted to hold the vigil during the day (which is when I'd be working), or had a little time at night, but I wanted an event like last year's that was a bit more ecumenical. Basically I came in late then ran out of time.

One good thing that came out of the [kerfuffle of Day 4](/One-Hundred-Days-Of-Action-004/) was that I put up a Facebook Group for others who want to take action on this issue, whether for 100 seconds or the full 100 days or more.  Come join us.
