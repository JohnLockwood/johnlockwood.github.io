Today I'm happy to report that a a [LightsForLiberty](https://www.facebook.com/events/422188168369266/) event will be taking place that I like to think I played a small part in precipitating, if only by helping to spread the word to the right people.  On Friday, July 12th at 7:00 PM, Pastor Brenda Stevenson will be leading a vigil at the [New Outreach Christian Center](https://www.facebook.com/NOCCM/), 3900 Gossett Ave (3.32 mi) Charlotte, North Carolina 28208. We're working to provide more details on the Facebook event page and look forward to seeing you Friday night!
