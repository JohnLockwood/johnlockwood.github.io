Happy New Year to all my readers, which at this point is likely to be just me.  But let's not fret about that. If need be I can chat with my wife and double my readership.

Today is New Year's Day, and so far it's been an awesome day. My wife, my daughter and I started out the year with some vegan waffles, then a 3.5 mile walk in beautiful cool, foggy weather for [Kidmiles](http://kidmiles.org). There was one little annoyance, however, detracting from an otherwise perfect day. <!-- More --> When we returned from our walk, I found myself sitting down at my computer and immediately trying to open Facebook in Chrome.  Fortunately my Site Blocker app knew better than me and redirected me to Google as it was set up to do.  As an aside, just now I went in to the configuration settings for the [Chrome Block Site Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en) to reset the default redirect to this site.  This will serve as a reminder to me to produce blog posts instead of randomly scrolling clickbait on FaceLinkTweet.

The lesson of this brief tale is just to be aware that, as with any habit, the habit of not using social media will take some time to develop.  While it does, the habit of using it will still sometimes take over.  

Should we really call that leftover habit "withdrawal"?  Well, having given up cigarettes and some other things in my life, I can say that no, what we're really looking at here is more like mental inertia than any kind of psychological or physical dependency. So, unless you're far more addicted than I was, giving up social media is likely to cause you no more than a minor inconvenience.
