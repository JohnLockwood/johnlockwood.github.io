Today's day FIVE of 100 Days of Action to end childhood concentration camps on the Southern US Border.  I've lost a little bit of the equilibrium that I had up until now.  So today's report will be pretty brief.

One good thing that came out of the [kerfuffle of Day 4](/One-Hundred-Days-Of-Action-004/) was that I put up a Facebook Group for others who want to take action on this issue, whether for 100 seconds or the full 100 days or more.  Come join us.
