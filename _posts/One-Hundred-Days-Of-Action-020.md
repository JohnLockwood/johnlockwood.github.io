Hello fans of not having kids in cages (in other words -- all decent people).  Today is Day 20 of 100 Days of Action!  

<!--more-->

Tonight I called down the list of local voters to try to get folks out to our [Charlotte Precinct 126 Democratic Party Organizing Meeting](https://www.facebook.com/events/1473858246095450/). The list I had was not a large one and I'm working with a fellow organizer on it, so it didn't take long at all to get through it, but it was good to check it off the to-do list.

By the way, I should probably point out that not having kids in concentration camps _shouldn't_ be a partisan issue, so if you're against it and you're a Republican, that's awesome.  Too often in this climate that's how it is, so organizing Democrats is all to the good.
