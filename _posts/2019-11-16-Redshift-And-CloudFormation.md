## Redshift and CloudFormation

Recently I was digging into Redshift a bit, so to make this easier I worked on a [Redshift  Cloudformation Template](https://github.com/JohnLockwood/cloudformation-redshift).  I'm pretty proud of this work in some respects, as it allows re-creating the Stack from a Redshift snapshot, for example.  One thing I haven't yet done for that project is to integrate AWS secrets or SSM Parameter values.  I'll be digging into this as part of my work toward getting my next AWS certification, [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer, Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/), which I should be able to announce by March, 2020, or perhaps earlier.
