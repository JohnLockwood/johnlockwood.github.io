### Congratulations to The Sacramento Buddhist Meditation Group

I want to give a heartfelt thanks to the [Sacramento Buddhist Meditation Group](http://sbmg.org) (SBMG) for a lovely evening. I've attended a few "sits" (group meditation sessions) over many years of being a very intermittent Buddhist, and the one I attended last night was the most impressive.<!-- More --> The celebration of the Sangha's anniversary precipitated a wonderful pot luck, and as my wife will tell you, I'm a sucker for anything that promises a full stomach.

But beyond that, the people were very warm and welcoming, and the facility was great, with the necessary equipment for both chair Buddhists and floor Buddhists to be comfortable. In the past I've found that many Buddhist meditation groups are heavily biased toward floor Buddhists, with chair Buddhists like me feeling like second class citizens. For that see [part one](http://localhost:4000/My-Meditation-Difficulties/). So anyway, whether you're a floor Buddhist or a chair Buddhist, you should stop by. In fact, the requirements are even easier than that, as they say on their [New to SBMG](http://sbmg.org/new-to-sbmg/) page:

<blockquote>Q.  Do I need to be a Buddhist to come to SBMG programs or classes?  
A. No. All who seek to live with wisdom and kindness are welcome."
</blockquote>

Of course, if you have a religion you're happy with, I'm certainly not trying to convert anyone here -- I'm just saying I think the Buddhist community has grown considerably in the years I've been in the area, and for my part I am both grateful for that and gladdened by it.
