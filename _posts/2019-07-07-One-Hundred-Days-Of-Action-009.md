Today I took what I hope will be both an important step and a fruitful one, even though it was simply as making a decision to fill out a form online.  Today I joined the [Poor People's Campaign](https://www.breachrepairers.org/poorpeoplescampaign), based on Dr. William Barber's call for a third reconstruction and a moral movement joining people of faith (like Dr. Barber) and people of no faith (like me).

I don't know where this will lead, really.  Some of the other efforts I've made so far have been major disappointments to me, but the whole point of having 100 Days of Action is that if you have any kind of conscience at all, [torturing](https://thehill.com/latino/450305-doctor-declares-conditions-detained-migrant-children-face-are-comparable-to-torture) immigrants in concentration camps is wrong. 

For those who object to that term, let me just briefly point out that  the same Trump supporters who don't like the term "Concentration Camp" were perfectly fine when their leader described Neo-nazis as "very fine people".  So if you're OK with Neo-Nazis being very fine people, you're really not in a defensible position to be squeamish about Paleo-Nazis -- any more than a fan of a cover version can claim the original release of the song was the merest garbage.

And in any case [concentration camps were invented by the British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_concentration_camps) some 31 years before the first political prisoners were beaten to death at Dachau.  

But forget the historical point for a moment.  The moral point is that if you believe that America is better than that, that it can't happen here, then it's you're duty to ensure we are better than that, and that it won't happen here.  And that's what the 100 Days of Action is all about, really.  

Whatever you call it, there have been Physicians inside, there have been attorneys inside, there have been members of Congress inside, and they all agree the conditions inside for Immigrants are abysmal.  The Inspector General of the camp -- the very department responsible for monitoring conditions, issued a report entitled [Management Alert - DHS Needs to Address Dangerous Overcrowding and Prolonged Detention of Children and Adults in the Rio Grande Valley](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-07/OIG-19-51-Jul19_.pdf).

So today I took the important if convenient step of officially casting my lot with Dr. William Barber.  It may not be true that "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."  I just know that the people I truly admire in my heart are those who are working like crazy to try to bend it that way.

So I'll stand with them, and I'll work in my own modest way to find others to stand with me.
