On day 4 of my #100DaysOfAction to end childhood detention on our Southern border, I created an event, which has since been cancelled due to a crazy person. 

<!-- 
***June 12th 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM, First Ward Park - [Event Link](https://www.facebook.com/events/2349283675314220/)***

Please join me for a [Charlotte Lights for Liberty Vigil](https://www.facebook.com/events/2349283675314220/).  

We're meeting in First Ward Park in the heart of downtown, near the rail line.  We still need help with:

* Speakers (Politicians?  Church Leaders?)
* Members of the Press and folks who can help us with promotion.

Please join us. Bring a sign -- bring a friend.

## Why I Thought You Should Have Come

Here's what's going on in Migrant detention camps, according to a Doctor who visited:

<blockquote>
Sevier, a private-practice physician in the Rio Grande Valley, was granted access to a facility in McAllen, Texas, after attorneys discovered a flu outbreak that sent five infants to a neonatal intensive-care unit. At the detention center — the largest such Border Patrol facility in the country — Sevier examined 39 children under the age of 18 facing conditions including “extreme cold temperatures, lights on 24 hours a day, no adequate access to medical care, basic sanitation, water, or adequate food.” All 39 exhibited signs of trauma.
</blockquote>
