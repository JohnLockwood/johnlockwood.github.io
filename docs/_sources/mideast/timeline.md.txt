# Timeline of Events

My interest in the timeline below is to focus on the background to the events discussed in such works as Chomsky's "Fateful Triangle: The United States, Israel, and the Palestinians."  It is, therefore, primarily focused on those three players, and is not meant to be comprehensive.

To date, this timeline reflects some [initial reading](resources	) but is drawn primarily from Wikipedia sources

* 1881-1903: [First Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Aliyah) - A major wave of Jewish immigration (aliyah), largely from Eastern Europe and Yemen
* 1915-1918: [Sinai and Palestine Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_and_Palestine_campaign). A front in World War I with fighting centered in the eponymous regions, culminating in the (partial) British defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the occupation of Palestine by the British.
* November, 1917: [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) was "a public statement issued by the British Government ... announcing its support for the establishment of a 'national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine."



* 1948 [Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba) Arabic for "catastrophe", this term refers to the violent ethnic cleansing of Palestinians through displacement and dispossession of land and property. This was a consequence of the British withdrawal from "Mandatory Palestine"
