# What Works: Program or Fellowship?

* Begin by asking about Norm's informal survey on whether alcoholics and addicts self-isolate.
* Why does this happen?  
	* Is it the stigma / shame of our drinking too much?  
	* Is it feeling out of place even if that's not true?
	* If it's the latter, is this social awkwardness part of something like an "alcoholic personality"?
* Is self-isolation a cause or an effect?
	* Rat park experiment
	* See this article on [The Neural Processes Interlinking Social Isolation, Social Support, and Problem Alcohol Use](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8059487/), which says that because we have high PB, we withdraw from social interactions, and this is a risk factor for alcoholism.

* How does AA aleviate this?	
	* Is it that everyone self-identifies as an alcoholic, removing the stigma?
	* Is it the identification with the stories allows one to "open up" or feel at home?
	* Interaction with the group; having a job
	* The meeting after the meeting.

* Why does AA focus on the program rather than the fellowship?
	* Historical -- needed a set of steps to grow the fellowship.
	* Necessary to have something for folks to focus on, to shift focus out of the group and back toward the individual.
