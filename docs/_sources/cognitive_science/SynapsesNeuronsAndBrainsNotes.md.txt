# Notes on Synapses, Neurons, and Brains

On October 18, 2023, I started on the course `Synapses, Neurons, and Brains <https://www.coursera.org/learn/synapses>`_.  Below are my notes on the course.  As always with notes, expect lots of abbreviated language and shortcuts.

Some dramatic billion-dollar projects include:
	* Allen Institute Seattle - Mouse/Human Brain Atlas
	* [Janelia farm](https://www.janelia.org/) - DC, USA 
	* EU Human brain project
	* President Obama's "Brain Activity Map" initiative

## Five exciting things:
* A [lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/synapses/lecture/5qrDn/the-connectomics) on [Connectomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectomics)
* Brainbow
* Brain-machine/Computer Interface (BMI)
* Optogenics
* Computer Simulation of the Brain (e.g. Blue Brain Project)

Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramon Y Cajal are "The Two Giants", the beginning of modern neuroscience.   Golgi stains actually only stain about < 1% of cells, so doesn't make tissue dark, you can then see those stained neurons (a later term).  1906 Nobel Prize.

## Connectomics

Connectomicsis modern anatomy wiring diagram -- cut very thin slices (nanometer resolutions).  Electron microscope used for this.  Detect slice structure separately, then reconnect slices.  So it's 3D mapping, so far done on pieces of brain, not whole brain.  

Prospects for connectomics is to give us a complete blueprint of healthy and sick brain, and we may start to bridge the "structure-to-function" problem, and get into simulation-based research.

## BrainBow

Genetic staining of neurons in vivo (light microscope -- micrometer resolution).  Harvard messing with mice genes, inserting pieces of DNA, when DNA is expressed, some cell types become colorful because of floursecent proteins (hence Brainbow).  By the way, synapses are too small for this resolution, but can see general placement of neurons.  Lot of art exhibitions based on this.  

Prospects of this are 1) structural basis for learning; 2) taggging and genetic characterization of different cell types, eg. in retina, or find out how many cell types you have 3) Tracing connections in circuits, short and long range.

## Brain Machine Interface

Electrodes implanted and listening to a single cell's spike, or a large group of cells.  Spikes are the common language.  Talks to an Artificial Neural Network, and then to a robotic arm.  Or can go the other way to ameliorate parkinsons, pulses from battery into basal ganglia.  Basically a pacemaker for brain.  Future challenges are 1) to be able to telemetrically record from within the brain without invasive electodes 2) real-time signal analysis. 3) Close the loop for movement with touching.

## Optogenetics

Idea is to tweak the genetics of cells to plant probes that are sensitive to light, so you can shine light of particular wavelength and have it generate a signal.  In nature, only retina is sensitive to light.  But existence of retinal receptors means there are genes that can code for molecules that are sensitive to light.  With two examples.  Ion channel Rhodopsin spikes when blue light shines on it. C.f. [Rhodopsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin).  Other example Natronomas pharaonis, yellow light prevents spikes.  Movie from Janelia Farm (aka now Janelia Research Campus), can induce mice to drink with blue light on certain group of cells.

## Blue Brain Project - Brain Simulation

Computer simulation (modeling) of neural circuits.  Lord Kelvin (William Thompson) quote:
"I am never content until I have constructed a mechanical model of the subject I am studying. If I succeed in making one, I understand; otherwise I do not." [BL]

Uses powerful "[Blue-Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Blue_Gene)" IBM computer.  Blue as in Big Blue, IBM.  Modeling is writing equation to describe types of spikes for certain class of cells.  Different equations for different spike (ultimately cell) types.

Modelling helps us to understand the network (e.g. by visualizing model in action).

So this is "simulation-based medicine [or s-b research]"
