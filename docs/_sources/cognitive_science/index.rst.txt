Cognitive Science
=================

I am beginning to study Cognitive Science.  Here are some things I'm working on:

* The `resources <Resources.html>`_  page lists things I am consulting or want to consult. 
* In addition to general reading and surfing, I'm working my way through the excellent introductory neuroscience course, Synapses, Neurons, and Brains, and have posted my `notes here <./SynapsesNeuronsAndBrainsNotes.html>`_.
