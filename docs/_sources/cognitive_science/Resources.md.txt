# Cognitive Science Resources

This list of resources is my working list of things I might like to consult.  I have not yet
worked through all of these, but as I do, I may link to a review or summary of my own.

## Books

## Reading / Read

[Consciousness Explained](OnReadingConsciousnessExplained), by Daniel Dennett.

[How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain](https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/how-emotions-are-made/) by Lisa Feldmean Barrett.  I am reading this now.  The main idea is the theory of the "construction of emotions", an active process in which our concepts (driven by language) play a large role.  I should write a longer review.  There's also a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KliAI9umFyY) by Dr. Barrett.

[Neuronal Dynamics: From single neurons to networks and models of cognition and beyond](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/book.html) Wulfram Gerstner et. al.  A challenging theoretical work on the mathematics of neuronal function, with Python exercises.

[The Self-Assembling Brain: How Neural Networks Grow Smarter](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Assembling-Brain-Neural-Networks-Smarter-ebook/dp/B08MVG2619/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PRQ5H5A3RMA8&keywords=Artificial+vs+biological+neural+networks&qid=1697460077&sprefix=artificial+vs+biological+neural+networks%2Caps%2C70&sr=8-1) by Peter Robin Hiesinger


[Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain, Enhanced Edition 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Neuroscience-Exploring-Enhanced-Mark-Bear-ebook/dp/B0873CMB7M/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1697458949&sr=8-1)
Mark Bear uses this in his own course on [Introduction to Neuroscience](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/9-01-introduction-to-neuroscience-fall-2007/) available on 
MIT OpenCourseWare.

[The Tell-Tale Brain:  A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human](https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Tale-Brain-Neuroscientists-Quest-Makes-ebook/dp/B004HW6AGA/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1697312278&sr=8-1)

[The Language Instinct:  How the Mind Creates Language](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Instinct-Creates-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061336467/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1697461992&sr=8-1) Steven Pinker

[The Evolution of Language](https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Language-Approaches/dp/052167736X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=F6K63LMSO57G&keywords=evolution+and+linguistics&qid=1697376808&sprefix=evolution+and+linguistics%2Caps%2C68&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.d977788f-1483-4f76-90a3-786e4cdc8f10) W. Techumseh Fitch - a good overview of the field.

## Other

[Plato's Camera: How the Physical Brain Captures a Landscape of Abstract Universals](https://www.amazon.com/Platos-Camera-Physical-Landscape-Universals-ebook/dp/B08BT2RFLS/ref=sr_1_2?crid=30W7DMUIHSRE7&keywords=Paul+Churchland&qid=1697312009&sprefix=paul+churchland%2Caps%2C81&sr=8-2) -- On how the brain learns to categorize


[Second Nature: Brain Science and Human Knowledge](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/0300120397/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1#reviews-filter-bar) -- Gerald Edelman.  A big influence on Barrett, but not well-reviewed.


## Other

One critical review of Gerald Edelman's Second Nature: Brain Science and Human Knowledge, contains this enticing bit of a thread to pull on:

* *"I've read loads of books now on the mind, from Searle, the Churchlands, Fodor, Pinker, Ramachandran, Gazzaniga, et al, and all of them are able to express themselves clearly even when discussing sophisticated concepts. But for me, reading anything by Gerald Edelman is a terrible chore - like some crazy reading comprehension test devised by a sadist - rather than an exciting journey through a brilliant mind."*
