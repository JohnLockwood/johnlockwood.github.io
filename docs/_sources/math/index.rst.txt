Whatever odd quirk beckoned to begin studying Calculus at same time I started being elligible for various senior discounts, whatever cowardice prevented me from the dreaded "taking it for credit" until Spring of 2024 -- here we are.  Many of my math notes are of course hand-drawn, messy, on paper.  These, in contrast, are done in Jupyter Notebook and SymPy.  They are messy and not on paper.
