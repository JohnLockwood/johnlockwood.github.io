## Teacher Meeting

2.5 # 5 and / or practice another.  See also the master it for this problem.

For reference:

Find the vertical asymptotes (if any) of the graph of the function. (Use n as an arbitrary integer if necessary. If an answer does not exist, enter DNE.)  On Desmos this was:  https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hmxnaqqijc

$$
g(\theta) = \frac{tan(2\theta)}{3\theta}
$$

3.1 # 3

Use the limit process to find the derviative of the function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{7}{x^2}
$$

By quotient rule, answer is $\frac{-14}{x^3}$

## Independently
