# Math Journal

* Monday, 12/11/2023:
	* Refine some precalc notes.
	* Calc I new course info notes.
	* Notes in Precalc OneDrive notes to examples in [Paul's Math Notes on Unit Circle (Calc Trig Review)](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/TrigFcns.aspx)
	* Begin notes on [double and half-angle formulas proofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epa2mi8hzBA).
* Tuesday, 12/12/2023
	* Continue viewing/notes on double and half-angle formula proofs.  In OneNote, with summary in LaTeX here, in [Double and Half-Angle Formulas](DoubleAndHalfAngleFormulas).
* Wednesday, 12/13/2023
	* Work on [How to Use the Double and Half Angle Formulas for Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf6p6lCs5I8)
	* Try paper + FriXion instead of Rocketbook
	* Discover and work with [SchoolYourself](https://schoolyourself.org)
* Thursday, December 14, 2023
	* Continue double and half angles.
* Weekend December 16-17, 2023
	* Began looking at Graph theory, in Introductory Discrete Mathematics (which is not the right tool for that or much of anything).
	* Found this Playlist for [Graph Theory with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXTDslxVfdM&list=PLLIPpKeh9v3ZFEHvNd5xqUrCkqLgXnekL), and began on first couple of videos.
	* Last item from searching for a review of [Introduction to Graph Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Graph-Theory-Dover-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00BX1DX9U/), which looks quite good.
* Monday December 18, 2023
	* Scanned earlier notes on double and half angles
	* Finished viewing [Solving the KÃ¶nigsberg Bridge Problem with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWhGcwlCoXE&list=PLLIPpKeh9v3ZFEHvNd5xqUrCkqLgXnekL&index=3)
	* Began [3 Ways To Represent Graphs in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukFNELi_U88&list=PLLIPpKeh9v3ZFEHvNd5xqUrCkqLgXnekL&index=3)
	* Read sample of Introduction to Graph Theory.
* Tuesday, December 19, 2023
	* Preview some [Python Graph Libraries](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGraphLibraries)
	* Continue working through [Graph Theory with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXTDslxVfdM&list=PLLIPpKeh9v3ZFEHvNd5xqUrCkqLgXnekL) videos.
	* Hack around some in igraph (in source/CodeSolid/GraphWork)
* Wednesday, December 20, 2023
	* Learn about magic X method -- something I saw Professor Leonard do.  Watched this:
	[Factoring Quadratics...How?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtN9_tCaRQc&t=332s).  Also [Intro to Solving Quadratics (Leonard Precalc # 16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEkJaPgjKs&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=17)
	* In source/CodeSolid/sympy-tutorial, review some SymPy stuff, in branch calculus_testing, file Precalc_Demo.ipynb.  Especially figure out how to change aspect ratio. :)
* Thurs Dec 21, 2023
	* Spent some time memorizing half-angle and double angle formulas.  Have them down pretty well, needs more attempts.
	* Some Desmos -- trying to figure out triangle tool.  Not good.  Also tried Geogebra.
