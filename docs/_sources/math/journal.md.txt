* Tuesday, 1/9
	* First day of Calculus class, Calc I, MAT 271 with Emma Scothorn.  "Rain" day, met virtually.

* Weds, 1/10/2014
	* Lot of time (about 5 hours) spent on homework 2.3.  (Need to do more problems 9, 11, and 12 especially).

* Thursday 1/11
	* First day in person Calc I Mat 271.  Units 2.2 and 2.3 on limits (review -- I was ahead on homework this week).  Calculator skills awful for a test, so...
	* When I got home figured out how to substitute values into an equation, to solve functions, where the cubed kerjigger is, how to not use minus when I mean negative since the device is dumb, and a few other things along the way.  Need about an hour a day to get good at this.
* Friday 1/12

	* Reading Russell Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy; first intro to [Peano's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms).
* Sunday 1/21/24
	* Continue reading Boyer, enjoyed especially ~ pp. 51-52 on Pythagoreans and Euclid's cool method for doing a golden section of a line segment, which he called finding the extreme and mean segment.  Began some reading and playing around with regular solids, found the formula for the interior angles of any regular polygon, given n = number of sides, interior angle formula is as below:
$$
	\frac{(n - 2) * 180}{n}
$$

E.g. for a triangle, $\frac{(3 - 2) * 180}{3} = \frac{180}{3} =60^o$

For a square, $\frac{(4 - 2) * 180}{4} = \frac{360}{4} = 90^o$

For a regular pentagon, $\frac{(5 - 2) * 180}{5}= \frac{540}{5} = \frac{540}{5} = 108^o$
