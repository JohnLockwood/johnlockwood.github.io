Today's Day 7 -- ONE WEEK -- of 100 Days of Action. I'm not sure if I missed yesterday, but in fairness, I did get rear-ended on the way home (everyone's fine -- just a bit sore).  Today I started exporting (somewhat by hand) made a list of possible supporters and friends.

These are folks who were going or interested in the meeting that was cancelled. Between folks interested in the meeting, politicians, religious leaders, and those involved in last year's Family Belong Together rally, I'm trying to build a small group of folks to (finally) stage another vigil in Charlotte.

Watch this space!
