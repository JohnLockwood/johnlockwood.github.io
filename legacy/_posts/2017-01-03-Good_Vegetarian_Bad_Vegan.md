Back when I was eating more vegetarian meals but still backsliding into the more than occasional hamburger, I tried to do the right thing by admitting I was a bad vegetarian. In retrospect I was no such thing. I was not a vegetarian at all. What I really was was an omnivore who was experimenting with portions.

Now that I'm a bad vegan (more on this below), I've been wondering why vegans have to call themselves vegans, since it seems to me that what we are is really vegetarians. <!-- More --> It's weird to me that people who eat only plants should need a word other than "vegetarian" to describe themselves, since vegetarian is a perfectly good word. So I did most of us do when we're wondering something:  I Googled it.

It turns out that the folks who coined the word vegan did so knowing that a bunch of people calling themselves vegetarians also drank milk and or eggs, neither one of which is a vegetable. So to distinguish themselves from those who were lying about eating vegetables, they made up a new word, vegan, which meant (according to the reference you visit), an "extreme vegetarian" or an "orthodox vegetarian". 

I also recently found out that vegans aren't supposed to wear leather or wool, which is what makes me a bad vegan, since I still have all kinds of leather shoes and belts. Given the difficulty I already have in finding the right-sized shoes, I don't think I could stand the snickering that ensue if I start asking "Do you have that in a wide width vegan model"?

So after all that time being a bad vegetarian, now that I'm a really good vegetarian, I've discovered that my leather shoes makes me a bad vegan.

I enjoy eating a lot more than trying to figure out what kind of eater I am. If I'm a vegan, I'll end up barefoot, and if I'm a vegetarian, I'll have to put up with people who say silly things like, "me too, but I eat chicken". 

If only food choices had a closet, like sexuality, we wouldn't be in this mess. You'd find me inside with the door locked.
