This vegan waffle recipe was quite good -- the only thing really disappointing about it was the fact that, made from scratch as it was, they required a bit more beating than waffles I've made in the past with Bisquick.  But they were crisp and tasty.

### Ingredients

* 1 3/4 cups all purpose whole wheat flour
* 2 tbsp flax seed meal + 6 tbsp water (i.e., 2 substitute "eggs")
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder (or substitute 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and one teaspoon of vinegar).
* 1 1/2 cups of vanilla soy milk (or regular soy milk)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil.
* Spray oil for the waffle iron.
* Optional - 2 single serving packets of Stevia for added sweetness.
* For serving:  Real maple syrup, or the jam or preserve of your choice to serve, or margarine.

# Preparation

Mix the non-serving ingredients in a large bowl.  You'll need a whisk or fork to mix them thoroughly until they're smooth and fairly consistent.  Choose your waffle iron setting (I like "low", but your mileage may vary), spray a bit of spray oil on the iron, and pour and cook as you normally would. Enjoy!

### Note:
If you're pursuing a Vegan diet with an eye to lowering your cholesterol or for other health benefits, the extra oil in the waffles in the margarine make them appropriate for special occasions, since such added oils should probably be limited or avoided as an every day thing.  If I can work out a healthier recipe I'll add it here.
