This recipe is a variation on the Hearty Stew recipe from LeAnn Campbell's excellent, book, [The China Study Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Cookbook-Plant-Based-Recipes/dp/1937856755).  Partly the variation came from the ingredients I had on hand, and partly it came about as a result of one mistake I made along the way, but the end product came out very well indeed so I'm sharing this variation here. <!-- More -->

### Ingredients

* 3 cups vegetable broth plus one cup broth saved from cooking seitan OR 4 cups vegetable broth plus (1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari sauce).
* 1 - 2 onions, chopped.
* 1 green bell pepper, diced.
* 4 cloves garlic, diced fine
* 1 butternut squash (approximately one pound), peeled and with seeds removed, cut into small cubes.
* 1 sweet potato, peeled, cut into small cubes.
* 2 15-oz jars of salsa, medium-hot.
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano.
* 2 zucchinis, sliced
* 1 15-oz can of pinto beans.
* 1 1/2 cups of corn
* Salt and black pepper to taste.
* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar

### Directions

1.  Put 2 tablespoons of vegetable broth plus balsamic vinegar into a large pot. Add chopped onions and cook until onions are soft, adding more vegetable broth as needed to prevent onions from sticking.  Add onions, bell pepper, and garlic.

2.  Add the rest of the vegetable broth and soy or tamari or / seitan broth, squash, sweet potatoes, salsa, and oregano.  Cook on low for about 15 minutes, until sweet potatoes and squash are beginning to get soft.

3. Add pinto beans, corn, and zucchini.  Continue cooking another 10 minutes.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
