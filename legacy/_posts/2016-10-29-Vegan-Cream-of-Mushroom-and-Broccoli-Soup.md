This is a recipe my wife and I enjoyed last weekend, so I thought I’d write it all down. It was a great, creamy soup. We like to cook enough on weekends to serve all week, so there’s probably about six servings in this recipe, more or less.

### Ingredients

* 2-4 cups of soy milk
* 1 cup vegetable broth
* 1 cup of water
* 1 cup cashews (I used roasted and salted, but plain roasted probably also works)
* 1 medium to large flower head of broccoli
* 1 1/4 pounds crimini mushrooms
* 5 small onions
* 3 tablespoons tamari sauce
* 1 tablespoon miso paste (probably optional)
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon ground garlic
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

Start by soaking the cashews in enough water to cover them.

In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil. Peel and chop the onions and cook until onions are translucent. Add the garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper, cooking and stirring for another minute or so, then add 2 cups of soy milk and the cup of vegetable broth. Bring to a boil and then reduce to low.

Rinse and chop the mushrooms up and add them to the pot to start cooking. Also, chop the broccoli head into a number of florets. Add the florets to the soup. The leftover stalk can be enjoyed raw while you’re cooking!

Once the cashews have been soaking for at least 30 minutes (longer is fine), add them and the water they’re soaking in to a blender, and liquefy them into a paste. Pour this paste into the pot. At this point you’ll need to think about the mixture of the moisture, since it should be pretty thick by now. So add more milk or water as needed. The goal is a consistency that’s thick and creamy without being so thick that the vegetables can’t cook well.

I added all 3 tablespoons of tamari, but you might start with less and add more to taste. You’d also add the miso and extra salt and pepper as needed at this point. If you’re using the miso paste, add gradually and stir well to disolve.

Cook until the mushrooms have gotten soft and the broccoli florets are no longer crunchy.

The result for us was a rich, creamy comfort food that can serve either as a main dish with bread or a great side dish.
