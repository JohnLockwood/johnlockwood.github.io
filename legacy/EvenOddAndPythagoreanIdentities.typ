= Even and Odd Pythagorean Identitles
== Heading Level 2

What even means -- symetric about the Y access.  Therefore opposite inputs give you equal outputs.  i.e.: 
$f(-theta) = f(theta)$.  Odd functions have symettry around the origin, so can rotate graph 180 degrees, so opposite inputs give you opposite outputs. I.e. $f(-theta) = - f(theta)$.  Remember x is $cos(theta),$ and y maps to $sin(theta)$  Look at positive and negative $ pi/6:  pi/6 = (sqrt(3)/2, 1/2), -pi/6 = (sqrt(3)/2, -1/2)$

Even:
cos, sec

Odd sin, csc, tan, cot  

Stands to reason because opposite angles are flipped accross x angles, and cos relates to y so it doesn't change.
