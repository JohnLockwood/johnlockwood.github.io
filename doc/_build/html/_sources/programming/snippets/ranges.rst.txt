Ranges
######

Ranges are a new feature in C++ 20.  I've a lot more to learn, but so far hey strike me as more useful than STL iterators (begin/end), 
though perhaps not as concise as classic loops (which are "unsafe", but not if you've learned them well).

Here's a small example.  

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/snippets/ranges.cpp
	:language: c++
