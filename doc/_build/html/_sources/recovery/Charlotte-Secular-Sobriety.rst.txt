# Charlotte Secular Sobriety

I'm pleased to announce the launch of an in-person [LifeRing Meeting in Charlotte](https://www.meetup.com/secular-alcoholism-addiction-recovery-group-lifering/).  LifeRing offers a secular approach to recovery from alcohol use disorder and other addictions.  We meet every Thursday, with precise meeting times and locations posted on the meetup site for now.
