As I approach retirement, the prospect of all those days that are not hollowed out by chasing larger paychecks has begun to create quite a lengthy to do list.

## Keep working?
At first of course I saw this problem of "What the heck am I to do with myself?" in the same terms I've always seen it, and my solution was the same: "I'll start a business," I think, "and work at that!" After a lifetime of work, I know how to fix the 
problem of too much time on my hands if I stop working.  I'll keep working!

To be sure, that idea is still on the table, since one of the core problems I'm looking for retirement to solve is working at a job I can't control and don't like.  If you're a developer you may know the type -- these are the sort of projects that are big enough to be both renumerative and have a decent work life balance.  Unfortunately, projects at that scale are often big enough to have soul-sapping chasms of beaurocracy so deep and wide that any velocity one may have had at the outset is dashed along with your foolish hopes.

## Do something better?

As time has gone on, however, I see an opportunity use my free time to solve larger problems than just my own quirky work preferences.
