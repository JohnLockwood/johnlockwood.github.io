C++ Lambdas
-----------

Work done:  8/24/2023

An excellent introduction to Lambdas is on [Microsoft's site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/lambda-expressions-in-cpp?view=msvc-170).

I haven't validated everything there, however -- there may be some compiler-specific MSVC directives or the like.
