Well, where to begin.  My name is John Lockwood, if you haven't pieced that together from the domain name and other obvious clues. I grew up in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and I come to Charlotte by way of Indiana, Maryland, Connecticut, and California.  If that's not confusing enough, my wife is from Colombia.  We'll be celebrating our ten year anniversary this year.

Don't feel bad if you didn't get us anything. I realize this is just a blog.  We're not that close

I don't have a big list of accomplishments or fun facts I feel like sharing now, but yes, I am quite aware that this web site needs to have my old content dredged up and re-purposed along with a lot of groovy new vibes.

Groovy new vibes. I love to talk the way people think I should because I'm a boomer, but actually I don't, really.
